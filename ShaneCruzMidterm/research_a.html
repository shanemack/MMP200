					<p id="image1">This site embodies a lot of things I would like my site to have as well.I admire this photographers style, as well as the quality of his images. I like the content this photographer displays on his site as well as the way he organizes it. You can see from the first image he displays a sample of his photography with images that contrast each other. Also, I like how he linked all of his social media. I would like to do the same for my social media.
					</p>

					<p id="image2"> I would like to display the fantastic photos of artists like the one visible. This photographer has provided an easy platform for you to purchase his photos. It is simple, descriptive, and easy to use. This photographer even has special release dates, with 1/1 prints. I'd like to be able to create a similar platform, that is easy to use. I wish to display my logo on top as well.
