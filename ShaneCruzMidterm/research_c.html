					<p id="image1">I am a big fan of Henry Chalfant and his photography. I would love to and plan on including pictures of graffiti on my site. Id also like a moving carousel on my header like he does. I also hope to have enough work, and stories to have my own documentary to sell and display on my site. I also like the placement of his logo at the top of the page, and how he personalized it by using his signature.</p>

					<p id="image2">This site embodies a lot of things I would like my site to have as well.I admire this photographers style, as well as the quality of his images. I like the content this photographer displays on his site as well as the way he organizes it. You can see from the first image he displays a sample of his photography with images that contrast each other. Also, I like how he linked all of his social media. I would like to do the same for my social media.
