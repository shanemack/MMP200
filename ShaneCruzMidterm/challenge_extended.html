				<p>	For the final project, I will create a website that provides examples of my photography, along with content that informs people of the reason behind my passion for and style of photography. My website will be a way to show people my capabilities as a photographer, while also connecting with them on a more personal level through original, engaging, and enlightening content. It will also include contact information for any possible business ventures, and the option of buying my prints. Also, I will connect my social media so my visitors can stay up to date with my work, and so I can interact with them on a more personal level.
</p>
				<p>My website is primarily to market myself as a photographer, but also to build a relationship with others and allow them to connect with my images on a deeper level. Young adults may have interest in exploring my website because they want to see some of my photos that relate to topics they find relevant or interesting. For my final project, I would like to link all my social media to the page and also provide a way people could purchase prints straight from the website. I would also like to add more written content as well as more images. Also maybe add a carousel of my images, and design a logo for the website to put in the header. I would also like to do whatever extra credit assignments are available, and continue to complete homework assignments, and edit and I did not get a high grade on.</p>
