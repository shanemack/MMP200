				<p>	The reason a professional or business may want to visit my website is if they are seeking a new, fresh photographer with the ability to create material for diverse purposes. A professional/business can use my website as a way to learn more about my photography and editing skill and style, through my brief insights of myself, and examples of my previous work. I have experience in commercial photography, as well as in freelance street photography. My website also provides an avenue of communication for them to contact me to further discuss their interests in having me shoot for them or for clarification of the structure in which I work with my clients.

				<p>  Also, any fans of photography or art students may be interested in visiting my website, whether to draw inspiration, buy prints, or simply just view aesthetically pleasing images. I know people of all ages enjoy street photography, but some of the younger fans are only viewing images through social media, so I will provide a link on my social media so they can visit the website easily. Newly engaged couples may also be interested in visiting my website. With my experience doing wedding photography, I can provide the same service, directing and shootings engagement pictures, ceremony, and reception pictures. Having worked with many ethnic, and religious backgrounds I am familiar with most cultures traditions, and requirements.
