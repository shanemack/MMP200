					<p id="image1">This website I chose features a lot of good content, and also a landing page that lets you easily navigate. The contact information is displayed clearly, as well as the location of the office. They have a simple design, but the description on the page gives you a clear idea of what you are about to indulge in. They give a short, but the informative description of Craig Paulson photography style, as well as a testimony of how long he has been a professional. I chose this website because the writing and photos are all things I want to embody as a professional and exude through my website.</p>

					<p id="image2"> This website also provides easy access to multiple albums organized in a very simple fashion. I would like to display my images in albums similar to his. Also, I would like to display some happy couples, with photos of their experience from the start of their wedding experience until the end. I was also contemplating adding a blog to my site as well, so people can share their photos and experiences I have captured.
